Inspired by the blogpost at [https://www.cheminformania.com/ligand-docking-with-smina/] and different “docking-by-
hand” protocols (e.g. by VR + IMD) published in major scientific journals, this workflow aimed to further lower 
the technical barrier for novice users to use molecular docking techniques, especially for researchers from 
experimental groups of related fields, allow them to focus more on the design process instead of software 
installation and command-line usage.

0. System requirements
    - Most 64bit computers running Windows, OSX or Linux should work.
    - More than 1 GB of disk space for software installation. Recommanded to have over 10 GB:
        - to store the data generated by the software 
        - to process the large molecular database downloaded for virtual screening

1. Intallation
    - This workflow majorly depends on pymol-open-source, smina and openbabel, which can be installed via anaconda.
    - Windows users also need a bash environment with necessary tools, we use msys2-base from anaconda distribution.
    - A sample installation script to install all the necessary tools (except the optimize plugin in pymol) have 
      been provided in the script directory for windows and OSX/linux (unix) users.
    - If you have PyMOL already and don't want to install another one, make sure your openbabel is installed in the 
      same python environment for the Optimize plugin to work. In that case, you only need to install smina. 
      You may still want to create a new conda enviroment so that smina can use a compatible version of python and
      openbabel without conflicting the openbabel already in your system.
      

2. Contents
2.0. README.txt
2.1. doc
    - instructions
    - tutorials
    - handouts
2.2. script
2.2.1. box-local
    - provide a protein-ligand complex and evaluate them with the vina scoring function
2.2.2. standard 
    - provide receptors and ligands in two separated folders, and evaluate all the ligands in each of the receptors
    - reference ligand must be provided to define the binding site
    - also include scripts for virtual screening (pending)

(2.3. worked-example: to reduce download size, will be provided separately upon request)
    (- example output files of demo 1-3 (tested on a Windows 10 2-in-1 tablet))
(2.3.1. demo1-manual-fit-eval)
    (- warm-up exercise for evaluating a set of manually-fitted complexes)
(2.3.2. demo2-standard
    (- example of the commonly adapted "standard" protocol of protein-ligand docking)
(2.3.3. demo3-screening
    (- simplified protocol of virtual screening)

3. Usage
3.1 See the "doc/tutorial" directory for practical examples
    - current version mainly supporting windows os
    - limited support for unix (actually the bash scripts should work given that you know what you are doing)
    - [demo for unix-based systems (linux and OS/X) is still work in progress.]

4. Remarks
    - see "RELEASE-PLAN.txt" for detailed plan of release.

5. Known Issues
    - On Windows version of PyMOL, resizing the window of Optimize plugin is buggy. Maximize it instead of reesizing to
      make it work.
